Revision history for Text-YAWikiFormater

0.51    2021/02/22
        I guess that once you use a version like '0.xx' you are stuck
        with no review numbers - they are converted differently.

0.51.1  2021/02/22
        just a version just as CPAN indexer complains that .50.[12]
        are smaller than 0.50

0.50.2  2021/02/22
        * update the change log with the changes for 0.50.1

0.50.1  2021/02/22
        minor fixes:
        * change how empty lines are handled
